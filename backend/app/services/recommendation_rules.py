"""The recommendation rule pipeline.

Five independent functions, each with the same shape —
`(RecommendationInput, list[ScoredSplit]) -> list[ScoredSplit]` — chained
together by `recommendation_engine.RuleBasedRecommendationEngine`. None of
them know about each other; each only reads `RecommendationInput` and
mutates the candidates it's given. That uniform shape is the actual seam for
"easy to replace with an ML model later": a future engine implementation can
keep some of these rules (e.g. `equipment_rule`'s hard disqualification is a
real constraint, not a preference, and would still apply to ML output) while
replacing the scoring rules with a model's predictions — without changing
this function signature, every existing rule keeps working unmodified.
