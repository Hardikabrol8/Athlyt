"""Schemas for the workout-plan hierarchy (`WorkoutPlan` → `WorkoutDay` →
`WorkoutExercise`). No router uses these yet — only the CRUD services and
their tests do, in this milestone. They exist now so the service layer's
function signatures are already shaped the way a future API layer will need
them, rather than being designed twice.
